- roblox-ts and pure Luau
- Source-mapped errors (Luau line numbers back to `.ts` files)
- Code coverage (via [Lute](https://github.com/luau-lang/lute) instrumentation)
- Two backends: Open Cloud (remote) and Studio (local)
- Multiple output formatters (human, agent, JSON, GitHub Actions)

> [!NOTE]
> roblox-ts projects currently require
> [@isentinel/roblox-ts](https://npmx.dev/package/@isentinel/roblox-ts) for
> source maps and coverage support.

## Install

```bash
npm install @isentinel/jest-roblox
```

### Standalone binary (no Node.js required)

Pre-built binaries are attached to each
[GitHub release](https://github.com/christopher-buss/jest-roblox-cli/releases).
Install with your preferred tool manager:

```bash
mise use github:christopher-buss/jest-roblox-cli
rokit add christopher-buss/jest-roblox-cli

```

Limitations vs the npm package:

- `--typecheck` and `--typecheckOnly` are not available
- `.ts` config files are not supported (use `.json`, `.js`, or `.mjs`)
- External tools (rojo, lute for coverage) must still be on your `PATH`

## Quick start

Add a `jest.config.ts` (or `.js`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml`) to your project
root:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "@isentinel/jest-roblox";

export default defineConfig({
	placeFile: "./game.rbxl",
	test: {
		projects: ["ReplicatedStorage/shared"],
	},
});
```

Then run:

```bash
jest-roblox
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run all tests
jest-roblox

# Run one file (TypeScript or Luau)
jest-roblox src/player.spec.ts
jest-roblox src/player.spec.luau

# Filter by test name
jest-roblox -t "should spawn"

# Filter by file path
jest-roblox --testPathPattern player
jest-roblox --testPathPattern="modifiers|define\\.spec|triggers"

# Use a specific backend (default "auto" picks Studio if the plugin is
# connected, else Open Cloud if credentials are set — see Backends below)
jest-roblox --backend studio
jest-roblox --backend open-cloud

# Collect coverage
jest-roblox --coverage

# Save game output (print/warn/error) to file
jest-roblox --gameOutput game-logs.txt

# Run only specific named projects
jest-roblox --project client
```

## Configuration

Config files are loaded by [c12](https://github.com/unjs/c12), which
auto-discovers `jest.config.*` in any format it supports (`.ts`, `.js`, `.mjs`,
`.cjs`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml`).

Configs can extend a shared base with `extends`:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
	extends: "../../jest.shared.ts",
	test: {
		projects: ["ReplicatedStorage/shared"],
	},
});
```

Precedence: CLI flags > config file > extended config > defaults.

### Root config fields

Two distinct buckets live at the root level. Jest passthrough fields live
under `test:` (see "Test fields" below).

#### Workspace Run Options

Atomic to one invocation — these describe what the run targets and how the
CLI presents output, not how any individual package runs. In `--workspace`
mode they resolve as: CLI flag > unanimous per-package declaration >
default. Mixed per-package declarations error loudly.

| Field | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `backend` | `"auto"`, `"open-cloud"`, or `"studio"` | `"auto"` |
| `color` | Use ANSI colors in console output | `true` |
| `formatters` | Output formatters (`"default"`, `"agent"`, `"json"`, `"github-actions"`) | `["default"]` |
| `gameOutput` | Write Game Output to a file — a path, or `true` for `game-output.log` under the root. In `--workspace` mode this is one grouped aggregate file across every package | — |
| `outputFile` | Write the Jest result JSON — a path, or `true` for `jest-output.log` under the root. In `--workspace` mode this is the single merged result across every package | — |
| `workspace.gameOutput` | `true` to also emit per-package Game Output files under `.jest-roblox/output/` (`--workspace` only) | — |
| `workspace.outputFile` | `true` to also emit per-package result files under `.jest-roblox/output/` (`--workspace` only) | — |
| `parallel` | Number of concurrent Open Cloud sessions, or `"auto"` (= `min(jobs, 3)`) | — |
| `placeId` | Open Cloud place ID | — |
| `port` | WebSocket port for Studio backend | `3001` |
| `silent` | Suppress console output | `false` |
| `universeId` | Open Cloud universe ID | — |

#### Per-package fields

Loaded per package (directly or via `extends: "../jest.shared.ts"`). The
workspace-root config is NOT a source of truth for these — declare them in
each package's own jest.config or in a shared config that every package
extends.

| Field | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `placeFile` | Path to your `.rbxl` file | `"./game.rbxl"` |
| `timeout` | Max time for tests to run (ms) | `300000` (5 min) |
| `sourceMap` | Map Luau errors back to TypeScript (roblox-ts only) | `true` |
| `rojoProject` | Path to your Rojo project file | auto |
| `jestPath` | Where Jest lives in the DataModel | auto |
| `showLuau` | Show Luau code snippets in failure output | `true` |
| `coverageCache` | Reuse incrementally-instrumented coverage shadow dir between runs | `true` |
| `luauRoots` | Where Luau files live for coverage instrumentation | auto from tsconfig `outDir` |

### Test fields

Put these under `test: { ... }`.

| Field | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `projects` | Where to look for tests in the DataModel | **required** |
| `testMatch` | Glob patterns that find test files | `**/*.spec.ts`, `**/*.test.ts`, etc. |
| `testPathIgnorePatterns` | Patterns to skip | `/node_modules/`, `/dist/`, `/out/` |
| `setupFiles` | Scripts to run before the test environment loads | — |
| `setupFilesAfterEnv` | Scripts to run after the test environment loads | — |
| `verbose` | Show individual test results | `false` |
| `silent` | Suppress console output | `false` |

### Coverage fields

Put these under `test: { ... }`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Coverage requires [Lute](https://github.com/luau-lang/lute) to be installed and
> on your `PATH`. Lute parses Luau ASTs so the CLI can insert coverage probes.

| Field | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `collectCoverage` | Turn on coverage | `false` |
| `coverageDirectory` | Where to write coverage reports | `"coverage"` |
| `coverageReporters` | Which report formats to use | `["text", "lcov"]` |
| `coverageThreshold` | Minimum coverage to pass | — |
| `coveragePathIgnorePatterns` | Files to leave out of coverage | test files, `node_modules`, `rbxts_include` |
| `collectCoverageFrom` | Globs for files to include in coverage | — |

### Project-level config

`projects` can be strings (DataModel paths) or objects with per-project
overrides:

```typescript
import { defineConfig, defineProject } from "@isentinel/jest-roblox";

export default defineConfig({
	placeFile: "./game.rbxl",
	test: {
		projects: [
			defineProject({
				test: {
					displayName: { name: "client", color: "magenta" },
					include: ["**/*.spec.ts"],
					mockDataModel: true,
					outDir: "out/src/client",
				},
			}),
			defineProject({
				test: {
					displayName: { name: "server", color: "white" },
					include: ["**/*.spec.ts"],
					outDir: "out/src/server",
				},
			}),
		],
	},
});
```

### Full example

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "@isentinel/jest-roblox";

export default defineConfig({
	backend: "open-cloud",
	jestPath: "ReplicatedStorage/Packages/Jest",
	placeFile: "./game.rbxl",
	test: {
		collectCoverage: true,
		coverageThreshold: {
			branches: 70,
			functions: 80,
			statements: 80,
		},
		projects: ["ReplicatedStorage/client", "ServerScriptService/server"],
	},
	timeout: 60000,
});
```

## Backends

Two ways to run tests, plus an auto-pick:

### Auto (default)

`--backend auto` (the default) probes for a connected Studio plugin first.
If detected, runs via Studio; otherwise falls back to Open Cloud — but only
if credentials are available (see Open Cloud below). With no plugin and no
credentials, the run errors instead of silently falling back.

### Open Cloud (remote)

Uploads your place file to Roblox and polls for results.

You need these environment variables:

| Variable | What it is |
|---|---|
| `ROBLOX_OPEN_CLOUD_API_KEY` | Your Open Cloud API key |
| `ROBLOX_UNIVERSE_ID` | The universe to run tests in |
| `ROBLOX_PLACE_ID` | The place to run tests in |

> Prefix any of the above with `JEST_` (e.g. `JEST_ROBLOX_PLACE_ID`) to override the unprefixed value. Use the `JEST_`-prefixed form when the generic names collide with other tooling.

#### Required scopes

Create the API key in the Creator Dashboard against the target universe, then
grant it the scopes below. A `403` at runtime surfaces as a `PermissionError`
with the missing scope name.

Always required:

| Scope | What it's for |
|---|---|
| `universe-places:write` | Publish the built `.rbxl` as a new place version |
| `universe.place.luau-execution-session:write` | Start the Luau session that runs the tests |

`--workspace --parallel >1` additionally requires the queue scopes for
work-stealing across concurrent sessions:

| Scope | What it's for |
|---|---|
| `memory-store.queue:add` / `:dequeue` / `:discard` | Work-stealing queue across concurrent sessions |

`--workspace --parallel >1` with a streaming formatter additionally requires:

| Scope | What it's for |
|---|---|
| `memory-store.sorted-map:read` / `:write` | Stream live per-package results back as packages finish |

Streaming is enabled by default and disabled only for `--silent`,
`--formatters json`, and `--formatters agent` (without `--verbose`).
`--formatters agent --verbose` re-enables streaming and therefore still
needs the sorted-map scopes; `--formatters github-actions` also streams.

### Studio (local)

Connects to Roblox Studio over WebSocket. Faster than Open Cloud (no upload
step), but Studio must be open with the plugin running. Studio doesn't expose which place is open, so
multiple concurrent projects aren't supported yet.

> [!NOTE]
> For `--coverage`, prefer `--backend open-cloud` since the coverage output is
> built to a separate output under `.jest-roblox/coverage/` that is likely not
> the studio place being served.

Install the plugin with [Drillbit](https://github.com/jacktabscode/drillbit):

#### Configuration file

Create a file named drillbit.toml in your project's directory.

```toml
[plugins.jest_roblox]
github = "https://github.com/christopher-buss/jest-roblox-cli/releases/download/v0.3.0/JestRobloxRunner.rbxm"
```

Then run `drillbit` and it will download the plugin and install it in Studio for you.

Or download `JestRobloxRunner.rbxm` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/christopher-buss/jest-roblox-cli/releases)
and drop it into your Studio plugins folder.

## Workspace mode

Run tests across multiple packages in a pnpm workspace in a single
invocation. Open Cloud only — Studio backend is not supported.

> [!NOTE]
> Package discovery uses one of two sources. By default it reads
> `pnpm-workspace.yaml` at the workspace root. Alternatively, declare a
> `workspace` block in your jest config (see
> [Workspaces without pnpm](#workspaces-without-pnpm)) to enumerate packages
> by glob — this works in Luau-only, npm, and yarn repos. `--affected-since`
> always delegates change detection to `turbo` or `nx` and is not yet wired
> for the `workspace.packages` source. When using Nx, each project's Nx name
> must match the `package.json` `name` field — `--affected-since` returns Nx
> project names and looks them up against the package list, so a mismatch
> surfaces as `Package "<name>" not found in workspace`.

Pick packages explicitly or by what changed:

```bash
# Specific packages
jest-roblox --workspace --packages @scope/pkg-a,@scope/pkg-b

# Everything changed since a git ref (via turbo/nx affected)
jest-roblox --workspace --affected-since main
```

`--workspace` must be combined with `--packages` or `--affected-since` —
the two are mutually exclusive, and either flag requires `--workspace`.

### Workspaces without pnpm

`pnpm-workspace.yaml` isn't required. Declare a `workspace` block in a shared
config and have every package extend it:

```ts
// packages/testing/jest.shared.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@isentinel/jest-roblox";

export default defineConfig({
	workspace: {
		packages: ["packages/*"], // globs relative to root
		root: "../..", // relative to THIS file; resolved at load
	},
	// shared jest options…
});
```

```ts
// packages/foo/jest.config.ts
export default { extends: "../testing/jest.shared.ts" };
```

`workspace.root` and `workspace.packages` must be declared together. `root` is
resolved to an absolute path relative to the file that declares it (the shared
config), so it points at the same directory no matter which package you run
from. Each glob in `packages` selects directories that contain a
`jest.config.*`; the package name comes from `package.json#name`, falling back
to the directory name (so Luau-only packages need no `package.json`). Every
selected package must resolve the same `workspace.packages`/`root` — inheriting
from one shared config guarantees this, and a package that overrides or omits
it fails the run.

Run from inside any package as usual. To run from a directory with no
resolvable jest config (e.g. the repo root), either point at the shared config
with `--workspace-root`:

```bash
jest-roblox --workspace --packages foo --workspace-root packages/testing
```

or add a re-export at the repo root so the config is discovered there:

```ts
// jest.config.ts (repo root)
export { default } from "./packages/testing/jest.shared.ts";
```

Per-package coverage is aggregated into a single report under
`<rootDir>/<coverageDirectory>`. `rootDir` defaults to the current working
directory, so run from the workspace root (or set `rootDir`) if you want
the report to land there.

Game Output has two independent sinks. Setting `gameOutput` (a path, or
`true`) writes one **grouped** aggregate file at the workspace root —
`[{ package, project, entries }]`, one group per (package, project) that ran.
Setting `workspace.gameOutput: true` writes a **per-package** file per
(package, project) under `.jest-roblox/output/`. Either, both, or neither
may be set; with both, humans see the aggregate announced and agents see the
per-package paths.

`outputFile` (the Jest result JSON) follows the same two-sink model:
`outputFile` (a path, or `true`) writes one merged result at the workspace
root, and `workspace.outputFile: true` writes a per-package result file per
(package, project) under `.jest-roblox/output/`.

## How it works

1. Finds files matching `testMatch` patterns
2. Builds a `.rbxl` via Rojo
3. Sends the place to Roblox (Open Cloud upload or Studio WebSocket)
4. Parses Jest JSON output from the session
5. Maps Luau line numbers to TypeScript via source maps (roblox-ts only)
6. Prints results

> [!NOTE]
> Coverage adds extra steps: copy Luau files, insert tracking probes, build a
> separate place file, then map hit counts back to source. For roblox-ts, this
> goes through source maps to report TypeScript lines.

## Test file patterns

Default `testMatch` patterns (configurable):

- TypeScript: `*.spec.ts`, `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.tsx`, `*.test.tsx`
- Luau: `*.spec.lua`, `*.test.lua`, `*.spec.luau`, `*.test.luau`
- Type tests: `*.spec-d.ts`, `*.test-d.ts`
