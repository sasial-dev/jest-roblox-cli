# jest-roblox-cli

CLI tool that runs Jest tests inside a real Roblox runtime via Open Cloud
(or a local Studio backend) and maps the results back to TypeScript source.

## Language

**Game Output**:
The dump of every line that surfaced in the Roblox Output during a test run —
native `print`/`warn`/`error`, engine warnings, anything `LogService` would
return. Surfaced via the `--gameOutput <path>` flag as a JSON array of
`{ message, messageType, timestamp }` records. Sourced from
`LogService.MessageOut`. Used for human inspection when a test run misbehaves.
_Avoid_: "Jest output", "stdout", "log dump"

**Banner Output**:
The narrower buffer that captures Jest's own writes to its `process.stdout` /
`process.stderr` Writeables via `InterceptWriteable`. Used only by the CLI's
error banner to surface synchronous exit messages (e.g. "No tests found,
exiting with code 1") that would otherwise be eaten by the Promise
rejection unwind. Not exposed as a user-facing flag.
_Avoid_: "captured stdout", "intercepted writes"

**Per-package Config**:
The loaded jest config for a single workspace package, possibly resolved via
`extends: "../jest.shared.ts"`. Source of truth for everything jest-shaped —
`testMatch`, `setupFiles`, `coverageCache`, `coveragePathIgnorePatterns`,
`rojoProject`, `gameOutput`, and so on. In workspace mode, the runtime reads
these knobs per-package; the workspace-root config file is not consulted for
them (HAL-231).
_Avoid_: "root config", "workspace-level config" — both imply a workspace
root config that drives package behavior, which is no longer the model.

**Workspace Run Options**:
The narrow set of knobs that are atomic to one workspace invocation:
`backend`, `placeId`, `universeId`, `silent`, `color`, `formatters`,
`parallel`. They describe what the run targets and how the CLI presents
output — not how any individual package runs. Resolved as CLI flag (or
documented env var) > per-package consensus > `DEFAULT_CONFIG`. Per-package
consensus means: every selected package's raw config must declare the field
equally, OR none of them declare it; mixed declarations error loudly.
_Avoid_: "workspace config" — the value isn't loaded from a workspace-root
config file.

**CLI Options**:
The argv parse result (`CliOptions` type). Flags passed explicitly on the
command line, plus any short-form aliases. CLI options layer on top of both
Workspace Run Options (via the resolution order above) and Per-package
Config (via `mergeCliWithConfig` in `loadPackages`).

## Relationships

- **Game Output** and **Banner Output** are two distinct captures with two
  distinct sinks: one feeds a user-readable file, the other feeds the CLI
  error banner. They are not merged or deduplicated.
- **Banner Output** ⊂ **Game Output** in content (Jest's `process.stdout`
  ultimately calls `print`, which lands in `LogService`), but the two
  captures run independently — Banner Output stays in scope as the
  synchronous, exit-safe path for the error banner.

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "My `warn(...)` in a spec doesn't appear in `--gameOutput`."
> **Maintainer:** "**Game Output** dumps `LogService.MessageOut`. If your
> warn isn't there, the LogService capture isn't wired up or the run
> didn't reach the warn. Either way it's not a **Banner Output** issue —
> the banner only shows up on Luau errors."

## Flagged ambiguities

- "Game Output" once meant "whatever the CLI returns as the second output
  slot of the Luau task script". That slot is implementation detail
  (sometimes `[]` placeholder, sometimes a real payload); the term now
  refers exclusively to the LogService-sourced dump regardless of
  transport.
