## Diagnostic Flags

| Flag                  | Purpose                                                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--verbose`           | See individual test results                                           |
| `--gameOutput <path>` | Capture all Luau print/warn/error to a file                           |
| `--no-coverage-cache` | Force a clean coverage re-instrumentation (skip incremental cache)    |
| `--no-show-luau`      | Hide Luau code snippets in failure output (useful for AI consumption) |
| `--formatters agent`  | Token-efficient output format for AI agents                           |
| `--no-color`          | Disable colored output (useful for CI logs)                           |

## General Approach

1. Start with `--verbose` to see which tests are running and failing
2. Use `--gameOutput game-output.log` to capture Luau runtime output (print,
   warn, error) that doesn't appear in test results
3. For source mapping issues, verify your `rojoProject` path and that the Rojo
   project tree matches the compiled output structure
4. For coverage issues, verify [lute](https://github.com/luau-lang/lute/) is
   installed and on PATH
