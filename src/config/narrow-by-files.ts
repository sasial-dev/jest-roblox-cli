/**
 * Translate a list of explicit test files (typically from CLI positional args)
 * into a `testPathPattern` regex that constrains Jest on the Luau side. Each
 * file's basename (without test-file extension) becomes a regex-escaped
 * fragment; multiple files are joined with `|`. An existing `testPathPattern`
 * is preserved by appending it as another alternative so user-specified
 * narrowing still applies.
 *
 * Basename-only is deliberate: the Luau-side path Jest matches against is
 * built from Roblox Instance names (e.g. `ReplicatedStorage/shared/.../foo`),
 * which won't contain the FS path prefix (`src/...`). Instance.Name preserves
 * the original file basename, so matching on basename reliably finds the
 * intended file — the one exception being an `index` stem, which roblox-ts
 * renames to `init` (see `indexStemToInit`).

 * the discovered files so Jest-on-Roblox matches the same files — its paths are
 * Roblox Instance names (e.g. `ServerScriptService/...`) with no `src/` prefix,
 * so a raw FS pattern like `src/server/foo.spec` matches zero files there.
